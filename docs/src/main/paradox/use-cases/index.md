Probably you have the perfect registration/authentication flow in your mind.
One of the biggest question; "This tool will support it?"

When we designed our APIs and technical flows, we come up with a lot of possible
use-cases and tried to support all of them.

The sub-pages will describe some possible implementation. 
If you have a concrate problem which is not fit any of the pre-documented ones, please
 - try to find out by the others if you can do it or not
 - if you can do it, help others and document it (PRs are welcomed)
 - if you can't do it, ask a question as an issue on github
 
@@@ warning

Right now we have no implemented 2FA or MFA support, but we are working on it.
